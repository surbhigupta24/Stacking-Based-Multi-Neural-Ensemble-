Stacking-Based Multi-Neural Ensemble for Cancer Prediction

A Novel Approach of Stacking-Based Multi-Neural Ensemble for Cancer Prediction

Installation: To run the scripts, you need to have installed:

Spyder(Python) 
Python 3.7
Python packages panda
pip install panda
Python packages panda
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow

You need to have root privileges, an internet connection, and at least 1 GB of free space on your hard disk.
Our scripts were originally developed on a Dell -15JPO9P computer with an Intel Core i7-8550U CPU 1.80GHz processor, with 8 GB of Random-Access Memory (RAM).

Dataset preparation: All the data files are shared with the code. Also, few of the data sources are online available. The respective links are available as following:
